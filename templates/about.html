                Crop diseases globally threaten agricultural productivity and food security significantly. To counter
                these threats, advanced technological solutions are essential. This is an approach for
                multi-crop disease detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented with web
                technology, aiming to enhance precision agriculture practices. Leveraging the power of deep learning,
                our work offers a scalable and efficient solution for identifying diseases across various crops. The
                web-based implementation ensures accessibility and ease of use for farmers and agricultural
                stakeholders. The motivation for developing a multi-crop disease detection system using CNNs and web
                technology lies in addressing pressing challenges such as agricultural productivity, food security,
                limited diagnostic capabilities, and the opportunities presented by technological advancements in AI and
                web development. This will provide farmers with timely insights to manage and control outbreaks,
                ultimately contributing to improved crop yields and sustainable agricultural practices. Our model
                achieves an accuracy of 94.45% on dataset comprises 25 classes of crop diseases, with a total of 5800
                images sourced from publicly available repositories on Kaggle. Leveraging the power of deep learning,
                our CNN model is trained on this diverse dataset to accurately identify disease patterns across
                various crops. The integration of web technology facilitates the deployment of our solution online,
                ensuring accessibility and ease of use for farmers and agricultural stakeholders.</p>
